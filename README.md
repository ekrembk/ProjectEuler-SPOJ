# ProjectEuler-SPOJ
This is the repo I share my solutions for ProjectEuler and SPOJ(<i>wow, how original</i>)

<b>So what's the point of this repo?</b>
<br>
ProjectEuler and SPOJ contain some very good problems to use various types of algorithms; so I wanted to solve those problems and I thought having a repo for my solutions would motivate me to solve more.

<b>About Me</b><br>
I started programming when I was 12. I wrote very basic code in C++, mostly in the level of a classic Hello World program. I learned basics of HTML, PHP, SQL and implemented several websites back then but none of them were significant projects; I just liked tinkering with the computer. As the time passed, I drifted away from programming but I knew that I wanted to study CS and I loved programming.

<br>
Right now I am studying CS in Sabanci University, Turkey
