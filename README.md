# ProjectEuler
Here, I share my Python code for solving ProjectEuler problems. My ProjectEuler username is "orancanoren".

<b>About Me</b><br>
I started programming when I was 12. I wrote very basic code in C++, mostly in the level of a classic Hello World program. I learned basics of HTML, PHP, SQL and implemented several websites back then but none of them were significant projects; I just liked tinkering with the computer. As the time passed, I drifted away from programming but I knew that I wanted to study CS and I loved programming.

Right now, I am studying CS in Sabanci Univeristy/Turkey. I started learning Python on my own in February 2016 and ProjectEuler is the place I test myself by solving problems based on mathematics. I like to share and to take a look at what others do in terms of solving these problems, thus in June 2016 I started this GitHub page to share what I do.
